# Storefront Backend Project

## Getting Started

This repo contains a basic Node and Express app to get you started in constructing an API. To get started, clone this repo and run `yarn` in your terminal at the project root.

## Required Technologies

Your application must make use of the following libraries:

- Postgres for the database
- Node/Express for the application logic
- dotenv from npm for managing environment variables
- db-migrate from npm for migrations
- jsonwebtoken from npm for working with JWTs
- jasmine from npm for testing

## Steps to Completion

### 1. Plan to Meet Requirements

In this repo there is a `REQUIREMENTS.md` document which outlines what this API needs to supply for the frontend, as well as the agreed upon data shapes to be passed between front and backend. This is much like a document you might come across in real life when building or extending an API.

Your first task is to read the requirements and update the document with the following:

- Determine the RESTful route for each endpoint listed. Add the RESTful route and HTTP verb to the document so that the frontend developer can begin to build their fetch requests.  
  **Example**: A SHOW route: 'blogs/:id' [GET]

- Design the Postgres database tables based off the data shape requirements. Add to the requirements document the database tables and columns being sure to mark foreign keys.  
  **Example**: You can format this however you like but these types of information should be provided
  Table: Books (id:varchar, title:varchar, author:varchar, published_year:varchar, publisher_id:string[foreign key to publishers table], pages:number)

**NOTE** It is important to remember that there might not be a one to one ratio between data shapes and database tables. Data shapes only outline the structure of objects being passed between frontend and API, the database may need multiple tables to store a single shape.

### 2. DB Creation and Migrations

Now that you have the structure of the databse outlined, it is time to create the database and migrations. Add the npm packages dotenv and db-migrate that we used in the course and setup your Postgres database. If you get stuck, you can always revisit the database lesson for a reminder.

You must also ensure that any sensitive information is hashed with bcrypt. If any passwords are found in plain text in your application it will not pass.

### 3. Models

Create the models for each database table. The methods in each model should map to the endpoints in `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Remember that these models should all have test suites and mocks.

### 4. Express Handlers

Set up the Express handlers to route incoming requests to the correct model method. Make sure that the endpoints you create match up with the enpoints listed in `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Endpoints must have tests and be CORS enabled.

### 5. JWTs

Add JWT functionality as shown in the course. Make sure that JWTs are required for the routes listed in `REQUIUREMENTS.md`.

### 6. QA and `README.md`

Before submitting, make sure that your project is complete with a `README.md`. Your `README.md` must include instructions for setting up and running your project including how you setup, run, and connect to your database.

Before submitting your project, spin it up and test each endpoint. If each one responds with data that matches the data shapes from the `REQUIREMENTS.md`, it is ready for submission!

## files structure

- build folder : contains the compiled code of the project in javascript
- node modules folder : contains all the dependencies of the project (could install all of it by running npm install command in terminal)
- src folder : contains all the source code of the project
- src/.server.ts : contains the code to run the server and express routes
- src/database.ts : contains the code to connect to the database and configure the env variables
- src/models : contains the code to define the models of the database
- src/handlers : contains the code to define the handlers of the routes
- src/handlers/authHandler.ts : contains the code to define the auth middlerware
- src/middleware: contains a middleware function to return the data of request owner
- src/tests : contains the code to test the project , each file corresponds to a single model

## other important file

- env file : contains the env variables of the project
- prettier file : contains the code formatting rules
- tsconfig file : contains the typescript configuration
- package.json file : contains the dependencies of the project
- package-lock.json file : contains the dependencies of the project
- docker-compose file : contains the configuration of the docker containers
- database.json file : contains the configuration of the database
- eslintrc file : contains the linting rules

## how to run the project

- install docker and docker-compose
- run npm install
- run docker-compose up command in terminal
- create two database as in the env file (finale, finale_test) then the migrations will do the rest
- run db-migrate up command in terminal to add tables to the database
- to run the project in development mode run start it will run the project in dev mode
- other commands
  - npm run build : to build the project
  - npm run start : to start the project
  - npm run test : to run the tests after building the project
  - npm run lint : to run the linting
  - npm run format : to format the code

## server ports = 3000 , database port = 5432 , username and password of database will be found in env file

## how to run the project without docker

- install postgres
- install node
- create a database with the name found in env file
